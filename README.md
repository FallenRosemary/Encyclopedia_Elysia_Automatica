# Encyclopedia Elysia Automatica

## Description: 
Encyclopedia Elysia Automatica is a 1.18.2 questing pack, but with a twist. You follow in the footsteps of Dr. Elysia Eden Raine, your run of the mill basement scientist who's documented most of her findings of this peculiar world of blocks in the Encyclopedia Elysia Automatica. A book containing all of her notes, experiments and discoveries in the form of quests.
